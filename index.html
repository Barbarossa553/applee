Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products from November 26, 2021, to November 29, 2021, at Apple Store locations, on apple.com, on the Apple Store app, and by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE. Apple Store locations: Qualifying purchases shall receive a discount equal to the value of the eligible Special Offer Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible product, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the Special Offer Apple Gift Card. Customers selecting Apple Card Monthly Installments (“ACMI”) as payment option at checkout or carrier financing shall receive a discount equal to the value of the eligible Special Offer Apple Gift Card off the price of the Special Offer Apple Gift Card and, for ACMI, will result in one ACMI installment at 0% APR for the full price eligible product. Apple.com, Apple Store app, 1-800-MY-APPLE: Qualifying purchases shall receive a discount equal to the value of the eligible Special Offer Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible product, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the Special Offer Apple Gift Card.

Rates as of April 1, 2020. If you choose the pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card.
